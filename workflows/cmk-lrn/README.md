# Learning lrn

CMake tutorials and other learning resources.

## Notes

Specify the generator via the cli
* cmake -G "Ninja"
* cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"

Specify generator for the project or environment, Stops ablity to use -G cli function?
* CMAKE_GENERATOR environment variable to set the generator
* Preload.cmake file in project directory, e.g. set(CMAKE_GENERATOR "Ninja" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
* As of CMake 3.19, CMakePresets.json files to set env varaibles and configure CMake, 

List generators that might be used on the platform - but not necessarly installed on the host machine
* cmake --help

## Status
TODO
* <todo: consider, compile with GCC g++ via Git Bash shell, >
* <todo: consider, install GNU make banaries for Windows, for GCC g++ compile via Git Bash shell, >

DONE
* <done: consider, intent to commit>
* <done: consider, installing Visual Studio 2022 Community, for Windows cl.exe compiler, MSVC for C/C++ >
* <todo: consider, reading first chapters of 'Professonal CMake, A Practical Guide' Part 1 Getting Started, free pdf download, >

Generators
* MSBuild, [WP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSBuild), FOSS?, for MS Win native tool chain?
* nmake, only available with Visual Studio 2022 etc MS licnece required. default generator on Windows for CMake so awks. 
* Ninja, to use in place of nmake, Linux and MS Win, and MacOS?
* xmake ??? <todo: investigate further. Linux and MS Win, and MacOS? >
